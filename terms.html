						NOTICE: THIS ASN LAB SOFTWARE PRODUCT, TOGETHER WITH ITS ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTATION, (THE "RODUCT") IS THE PROPERTY OF ASN LAB.  
						THE PRODUCT IS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU, THE ORIGINAL PURCHASER, SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING LICENSE AGREEMENT ("LICENSE AGREEMENT").  
						PLEASE READ THIS LICENSE CAREFULLY BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING THE PRODUCT.  
						A COPY OF THIS LICENSE IS AVAILABLE FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE IN THE "LICENSE.HTML"FILE PROVIDED WITH THE PRODUCT.</p>
						<p style="font-weight:bold;">
						IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED
						BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE PRODUCT. ANY USE BY YOU OF THIS PRODUCT ALSO CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS.
						</p>
						<p>
						ASN Lab is only willing to grant you a license under this License Agreement if you obtained the Product from ASN Lab or a ASN Lab authorized distributor or reseller. 
						If you obtained the Product from any other source you may not install or use the Product.
						</p>
						
						<h3>1. GRANT OF LICENSE AND SCOPE OF USE</h3>
						<p>
						<strong>1.1 Licenses</strong>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;For each license that you acquire to use the Product, you will be provided with a License Key (a &quot;License Key&quot;),
						which contains the installation and licensing instructions, an activation key and which may be provided to you either with the Product media or separately by ASN Lab or its authorized distributors or resellers.
						The License Key will contain information specific to the Product, the type of license under which you may use the Product and the number of licenses that you have acquired.
						In order to activate and use the Product as set forth in this License Agreement, you must follow the instructions when prompted by the Product.  
						The types of licenses you may acquire are an Evaluation License, a Developer's License, all defined in this Section 1 of this License Agreement.
						Unless your License identifies your acquisition of another license type, you have acquired a Developer's License.
						For more information on which license types, if any, should be included with the Product media you should contact ASN Lab or your ASN Lab authorized distributor or reseller.
						</p>

						<p>
						<strong>1.2 Evaluation License</strong>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to evaluate the Product, you may install the Product, as outlined below, on a temporary basis for evaluation, non-commercial purposes only (the &quot;Evaluation Period&quot;).  
						The Evaluation Period is limited to the lesser of the period of time specified to you by ASN Lab or thirty (30) days from the date the Product is installed.
						At the end of the Evaluation Period your license to use the Product expires.  
						During the Evaluation Period, ASN Lab grants you the personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product solely for evaluation purposes.  
						THE PRODUCT CONTAINS A TIME-OUT FEATURE THAT DISABLES ITS OPERATION AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD.  
						APPLICATIONS THAT YOU CREATE DURING THE EVALUATION PERIOD MAY REQUIRE THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO RUN. 
						UPON EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD, THOSE APPLICATIONS WILL NO LONGER RUN.  
						YOU SHOULD THEREFORE TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT RESULT.  
						In order to use the Product after the Evaluation Period, 
						you must obtain from ASN Lab, 
						or its authorized distributors or resellers a License Key outlining the number and type of grants of a license to use the Product in accordance with the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.
						You may not use the Product during the Evaluation Period for any commercial, business, governmental or institutional purpose of any kind. 
						At the end of the Evaluation Period, further use of the Product by you is prohibited without the purchase of a commercial license to obtain a License Key.
						If you do not purchase a license for the Product at the end of the Evaluation Period, 
						you hereby agree to permanently remove or delete the Product from all computer systems, 
						including servers, workstations, microsystems, on which it was installed and deployed any software and documentation received, 
						and not to reinstall the Product. 
						If you desire to continue to use the Product following the Evaluation Period, 
						you should contact ASN Lab or a ASN Lab authorized distributor or reseller to order commercial licenses to use the Product.
						</p>

						<p>
						<strong>1.3 Developer License</strong>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of this Section 1.3 are applicable to you only if you have purchased a Developer License, as defined below,
						for the Product directly from ASN Lab or a ASN Lab authorized distributor or reseller. 
						Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, ASN Lab grants to you, if you are an individual, 
						or, if you are an entity, one (1) designated person in your organization (&quot;Developer&quot;) a personal,
						nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product solely for your own internal purposes. 
						You may purchase from ASN Lab or a ASN Lab authorized distributor or reseller additional licenses to permit multiple Developers to use the Product (each, a &quot;Developer License&quot;).
						The foregoing Developer Licenses shall be for access and use, only by the equivalent number of Developers for whom you have paid the applicable license fees and obtained a License Key.
						The Product may be used exclusively by the specifically designated Developers, subject to all the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.
						You agree that you will not designate more Developers than the number of Developer Licenses that ASN Lab or a ASN Lab authorized distributor or reseller has expressly granted to you
						and you will not allow the Product to be used by any individuals other than the Developers designated by you from time to time.
						You may install the Product on a reasonable number of machines provided that the Developer is the only individual permitted to use the Product.
						Subject to the other terms and conditions of this License, 
						you may make a reasonable number of copies of the Product to backup devices such as hard disks, 
						optical media, or tape and one (1) physical CD media backup copy of the Product solely to replace the original copy provided to you if the original copy is damaged or destroyed. 
						All rights not specifically granted to you herein are retained by ASN Lab.
						</p>

						<h3>2. SPECIAL TERMS</h3>   

						<p>
						The following terms and conditions (&quot;Special Terms&quot;) are specific to certain editions, 
						versions and components of the Product and are in addition to the provisions of Section 1.  
						If any provision of the Special Terms applicable to the Product conflicts with any other provision of this License,

						</p>

						<p>
						<strong>2.1 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO SOFTWARE LICENSED FOR EDUCATIONAL USE</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you may exercise your rights under this License Agreement

						specifically designated as &quot;redistributables&quot; by ASN Lab in the accompanying printed or on-line documentation and 
						that are necessary to use your own application programs and other works created using the Product (&quot;Redistributables&quot;), 
						and such End User's sublicense rights to the Redistributables are conditioned upon compliance with such limitations.  
						The limitations in this Section 3 apply equally to your use of the Product, 
						in whole or in part, including any component or Redistributable.
						</p>

						</p>

						<h3>5. SERVICES; UPDATES; PRODUCT CHANGES</h3> 
						<p>
						ASN Lab is not required under this License Agreement to provide any installation, training or other services to you.  
						Such services, if available, must be purchased separately.  If, pursuant to a separate support agreement or otherwise, 
						ASN Lab provides you with a new release, error correction, update, upgrade or other modification to the Product, 
						such modification will be deemed part of the Product, and subject to the terms of this License Agreement, 
						unless the modification is expressly provided subject to a separate license agreement. 
						ASN Lab reserves the right at any time not to release or to discontinue release of any Product and to alter prices, 
						features, specifications, capabilities, functions, licensing terms, release dates, general availability or other characteristics of any future releases of the Product.

						SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY OR DATA, 
						ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT OR THE PRODUCT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE, 
						EVEN IF ASN LAB KNEW, SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  
						ASN LAB'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT OR THE PRODUCT, 
						WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU UNDER THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT.
