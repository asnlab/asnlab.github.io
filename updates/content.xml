THE PRODUCT IS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU, THE ORIGINAL PURCHASER,&#xA;SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING LICENSE AGREEMENT (&quot;LICENSE AGREEMENT&quot;). PLEASE&#xA;READ THIS LICENSE CAREFULLY BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING THE PRODUCT. A COPY&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE IS AVAILABLE FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE IN THE&#xA;&quot;LICENSE.HTML&quot;FILE PROVIDED WITH THE PRODUCT.&#xA;&#xA;IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES&#xA;INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE PRODUCT. ANY USE&#xA;BY YOU OF THIS PRODUCT ALSO CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS.&#xA;&#xA;ASN Lab is only willing to grant you a license under this License Agreement if you obtained the Product from&#xA;ASN Lab or a ASN Lab authorized distributor or reseller. If you obtained the Product from any other source you&#xA;may not install or use the Product.&#xA;&#xA;1. GRANT OF LICENSE AND SCOPE OF USE&#xA;&#xA;1.1 Licenses   For each license that you acquire to use the Product, you will be provided with a License Key (a &quot;License Key&quot;), which contains the installation and licensing instructions, an activation key and which may be provided to you either with the Product media or separately by ASN Lab or its authorized distributors or resellers. The License Key will contain information specific to the Product, the type of license under which you may use the Product and the number of licenses that you have acquired. In order to activate and use the Product as set forth in this License Agreement, you must follow the instructions when prompted by the Product. The types of licenses you may acquire are an Evaluation License, a Developer License, all defined in this Section 1 of this License Agreement. Unless your License Key identifies your acquisition of another license type, you have acquired a Developer License. For more information on which license types, if any, should be included with the Product media you should contact ASN Lab or your&#xA;ASN Lab authorized distributor or reseller.&#xA;&#xA;1.2 Evaluation License   In order to evaluate the Product, you may install the Product, as outlined below, on a temporary basis for evaluation, non-commercial purposes only (the &quot;Evaluation Period&quot;). The Evaluation Period is limited to the lesser of the period of time specified to you by ASN Lab or thirty (30) days from the date the Product is installed. At the end of the Evaluation Period your license to use the Product expires. During the Evaluation Period, ASN Lab grants you the personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product solely for evaluation purposes. THE PRODUCT CONTAINS A TIME-OUT FEATURE THAT DISABLES ITS OPERATION AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD. APPLICATIONS THAT YOU CREATE DURING THE EVALUATION PERIOD MAY REQUIRE THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO RUN. UPON EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD, THOSE APPLICATIONS WILL NO LONGER RUN. YOU SHOULD THEREFORE TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT RESULT. In order to use the Product after the Evaluation Period, you must obtain from ASN Lab, or its authorized distributors or resellers a License Key outlining the number and type of grants of a license to use the Product in accordance with the terms and conditions of this  License Agreement. You may not use the Product during the Evaluation Period for any commercial, business,  governmental or institutional purpose of any kind. At the end of the Evaluation Period, further use of the Product  by you is prohibited without the purchase of a commercial license to obtain a License Key. If you do  not purchase a license for the Product at the end of the Evaluation Period, you hereby agree to permanently  remove or delete the Product from all computer systems, including servers, workstations, microsystems, on which  it was installed and deployed any software and documentation received, and not to reinstall the Product. If you  desire to continue to use the Product following the Evaluation Period, you should contact ASN Lab or a ASN Lab authorized distributor or reseller to order commercial licenses to use the Product. &#xA;&#xA;1.3 Developer License   The terms of this Section 1.3 are applicable to you only if you have  purchased a Developer License, as defined below, for the Product directly from ASN Lab or a ASN Lab authorized distributor or reseller. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, ASN Lab grants to you, if you are an individual, or, if you are an entity, one (1) designated person in your organization (&quot;Developer&quot;) a personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product solely for your own internal purposes. You may purchase from ASN Lab or a ASN Lab authorized distributor or reseller additional licenses to permit multiple Developers to use the Product (each, a &quot;Developer License&quot;). The foregoing Developer Licenses shall be for access and use, only by the equivalent number of Developers for whom you have paid the applicable license fees and obtained a License Key. The Product may be used exclusively by the specifically designated Developers, subject to all the terms and conditions of this License Agreement. You agree that you will not designate more Developers than the number of Developer Licenses that ASN Lab or a ASN Lab authorized distributor or reseller has expressly granted to you and you will not allow the Product to be used by any individuals other than the Developers designated by you from time to time. You may install the Product on a reasonable number of machines provided that the Developer is the only individual permitted to use the Product. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this License, you may make a reasonable number of copies of the Product to backup devices such as hard disks, optical media, or tape and one (1) physical CD media backup copy of the Product solely to replace the original copy provided to you if the original copy is damaged or destroyed. All rights not specifically granted to you herein are retained by ASN Lab.&#xA;&#xA;2. SPECIAL TERMS&#xA;The following terms and conditions (&quot;Special Terms&quot;) are specific to certain editions, versions and components of the Product and are in addition to the provisions of Section 1. If any provision of the Special Terms applicable to the Product conflicts with any other provision of this License, then the provision of the Special Terms will supercede and control. &#xA;&#xA;2.1 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO SOFTWARE LICENSED FOR EDUCATIONAL USE Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you may exercise your rights under this License Agreement to  use the Product solely for your own personal use in providing or receiving instruction within the limited scope of guided computer programming and/or software training courses (&quot;Courses&quot;) in which you are a direct and personal participant, either as student or instructor. You may not use any Works created with the Product for any commercial, business, governmental or institutional purpose of any kind, except to the extent you are an instructor teaching a Course. All rights not specifically granted to you herein are retained by ASN Lab.&#xA;&#xA;3. LIMITATIONS&#xA;You may not: (a) modify, adapt, alter, translate, or create derivative works of the Product or merge the Product with other software other than as described in the Product&apos;s accompanying documentation or as approved of in writing by ASN Lab; (b) lease, rent or loan the Product to any third party; (c) sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Product or any component thereof to any third party except as expressly authorized in this Agreement; (d) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Product; (e) remove, alter, or obscure any confidentiality or proprietary notices (including copyright and trademark notices) of ASN Lab or its licensors or suppliers on or accompanying the Product; (f) allow third parties to access or use the Product including but not limited to using the Product in a time-sharing arrangement, operating the Product as part of a service bureau or, except as expressly authorized under Sections 1 and 2 otherwise using the Product for the use or benefit of third parties; (g) reproduce or use the Product except as expressly authorized under Sections 1 and 2; or (h) disclose or publish performance benchmark results for the Product. The rights granted under this License apply only to this Product. You must procure a separate license to use other ASN Lab software. Furthermore, you may not permit end users of the Product (&quot;End Users&quot;) to conduct the restricted activities limited by items (a) through (e), (g) and (h) above insofar as they apply to certain files, libraries and/or source code specifically designated as &quot;redistributables&quot; by ASN Lab in the accompanying printed or on-line documentation and that are necessary to use your own application programs and other works created using the Product (&quot;Redistributables&quot;), and such End User&apos;s sublicense rights to the Redistributables are conditioned upon compliance with such limitations. The limitations in this Section 3 apply equally to your use of the Product, in whole or in part, including any component or Redistributable.&#xA;&#xA;4. LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER&#xA;ASN Lab warrants to you, the original purchaser and to no other party, that any physical media included with the Product, as and when provided to you, will be free of physical defects in materials and workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days after the date that you initially acquire the Product. Your exclusive remedy and ASN Lab&apos;s sole liability for breach of this warranty is that ASN Lab will replace any defective media returned to ASN Lab within the ninety (90) day warranty period. This warranty does not apply to damages resulting from misuse, abuse or neglect. Any replacement media will be warranted as above for the remainder of the original warranty period or twenty (20) days from the date we ship it to you, whichever is longer. EXCEPT FOR THIS EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTY, THE PRODUCT IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. ASN LAB HEREBY EXCLUDES AND DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, RESULTS, EFFORTS OR QUIET ENJOYMENT. THERE IS NO WARRANTY THAT THE PRODUCT WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR WILL FUNCTION WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK FOR THE RESULTS OBTAINED USING THE PRODUCT. TO THE EXTENT THAT ASN LAB MAY NOT DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY AS A MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW, THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF SUCH WARRANTY WILL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED UNDER SUCH LAW.&#xA;&#xA;5. SERVICES; UPDATES; PRODUCT CHANGES&#xA;ASN Lab is not required under this License Agreement to provide any installation, training or other services to you. Such services, if available, must be purchased separately. If, pursuant to a separate support agreement or otherwise, ASN Lab provides you with a new release, error correction, update, upgrade or other modification to the Product, such modification will be deemed part of the Product, and subject to the terms of this License Agreement, unless the modification is expressly provided subject to a separate license agreement. ASN Lab reserves the right at any time not to release or to discontinue release of any Product and to alter prices, features, specifications, capabilities, functions, licensing terms, release dates, general availability or other characteristics of any future releases of the Product.&#xA;&#xA;6.

        <property name='df_LT.license' value='SHANNON CORPORATION LICENSE TERMS&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE: THIS SHANNON SOFTWARE PRODUCT, TOGETHER WITH ITS ACCOMPANYING&#xA;DOCUMENTATION, (THE &quot;RODUCT&quot;) IS THE PROPERTY OF SHANNON CORPORATION&#xA;(&quot;SHANNON&quot;). THE PRODUCT IS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU, THE ORIGINAL PURCHASER,&#xA;SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING LICENSE AGREEMENT (&quot;LICENSE AGREEMENT&quot;). PLEASE&#xA;READ THIS LICENSE CAREFULLY BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING THE PRODUCT. A COPY&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE IS AVAILABLE FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE IN THE&#xA;&quot;LICENSE.HTML&quot;FILE PROVIDED WITH THE PRODUCT.&#xA;&#xA;IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES&#xA;INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE PRODUCT. ANY USE&#xA;BY YOU OF THIS PRODUCT ALSO CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS.&#xA;&#xA;Shannon is only willing to grant you a license under this License Agreement if you obtained the Product from&#xA;Shannon or a Shannon authorized distributor or reseller. If you obtained the Product from any other source you&#xA;may not install or use the Product.&#xA;&#xA;1. GRANT OF LICENSE AND SCOPE OF USE&#xA;&#xA;1.1 Licenses   For each license that you acquire to use the Product, you will be provided with a License Certificate (a &quot;License Certificate&quot;), which may be either a certificate, the installation and licensing instructions, your invoice, or an activation file and which may be provided to you either with the Product media or separately by Shannon or its authorized distributors or resellers. The License Certificate will contain information specific to the Product, the type of license under which you may use the Product and the number of licenses that you have acquired. In order to activate and use the Product as set forth in this License Agreement, you must follow the instructions when prompted by the Product. The types of licenses you may acquire are an Evaluation License, a Named User License, all defined in this Section 1 of this License Agreement. Unless your License Certificate identifies your acquisition of another license type, you have acquired a Named User License. For more information on which license types, if any, should be included with the Product media you should contact Shannon or your&#xA;Shannon authorized distributor or reseller.&#xA;&#xA;1.2 Evaluation Period   In order to evaluate the Product, you may install the Product, as outlined below, on a temporary basis for evaluation, non-commercial purposes only (the &quot;Evaluation Period&quot;). The Evaluation Period is limited to the lesser of the period of time specified to you by Shannon or ninety (90) days from the date the Product is installed. At the end of the Evaluation Period your license to use the Product expires. During the Evaluation Period, Shannon grants you the personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product solely for evaluation purposes. THE PRODUCT CONTAINS A TIME-OUT FEATURE THAT DISABLES ITS OPERATION AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD. APPLICATIONS THAT YOU CREATE DURING THE EVALUATION PERIOD MAY REQUIRE THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO RUN. UPON EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD, THOSE APPLICATIONS WILL NO LONGER RUN. YOU SHOULD THEREFORE TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT RESULT. In order to use the Product after the Evaluation Period, you must obtain from Shannon, or its authorized distributors or resellers a License Key Certificate outlining the number and type of grants of a license to use the Product in accordance with the terms and conditions of this  License Agreement. You may not use the Product during the Evaluation Period for any commercial, business,  governmental or institutional purpose of any kind. At the end of the Evaluation Period, further use of the Product  by you is prohibited without the purchase of a commercial license to obtain a License Key Certificate. If you do  not purchase a license for the Product at the end of the Evaluation Period, you hereby agree to permanently  remove or delete the Product from all computer systems, including servers, workstations, microsystems, on which  it was installed and deployed any software and documentation received, and not to reinstall the Product. If you  desire to continue to use the Product following the Evaluation Period, you should contact Shannon or a Shannon authorized distributor or reseller to order commercial licenses to use the Product. &#xA;&#xA;1.3 Named User Grant of License   The terms of this Section 1.3 are applicable to you only if you have  purchased a Named User License, as defined below, for the Product directly from Shannon or a Shannon authorized distributor or reseller. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Shannon grants to you, if you are an individual, or, if you are an entity, one (1) designated person in your organization (&quot;Named User&quot;) a personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product solely for your own internal purposes. You may purchase from shannon or a shannon authorized distributor or reseller additional licenses to permit multiple Named Users to use the Product (each, a &quot;Named User License&quot;). The foregoing Named User Licenses shall be for access and use, only by the equivalent number of Named Users for whom you have paid the applicable license fees and obtained a License Key Certificate. The Product may be used exclusively by the specifically designated Named Users, subject to all the terms and conditions of this License Agreement. You agree that you will not designate more Named Users than the number of Named User Licenses that Shannon or a Shannon authorized distributor or reseller has expressly granted to you and you will not allow the Product to be used by any individuals other than the Named Users designated by you from time to time. You may install the Product on a reasonable number of machines provided that the Named User is the only individual permitted to use the Product. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this License, you may make a reasonable number of copies of the Product to backup devices such as hard disks, optical media, or tape and one (1) physical CD media backup copy of the Product solely to replace the original copy provided to you if the original copy is damaged or destroyed. All rights not specifically granted to you herein are retained by Shannon.&#xA;&#xA;2. SPECIAL TERMS&#xA;The following terms and conditions (&quot;Special Terms&quot;) are specific to certain editions, versions and components of the Product and are in addition to the provisions of Section 1. If any provision of the Special Terms applicable to the Product conflicts with any other provision of this License, then the provision of the Special Terms will supercede and control. &#xA;&#xA;2.1 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO SOFTWARE LICENSED FOR EDUCATIONAL USE Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you may exercise your rights under this License Agreement to  use the Product solely for your own personal use in providing or receiving instruction within the limited scope of guided computer programming and/or software training courses (&quot;Courses&quot;) in which you are a direct and personal participant, either as student or instructor. You may not use any Works created with the Product for any commercial, business, governmental or institutional purpose of any kind, except to the extent you are an instructor teaching a Course.

The rights granted under this License apply only to this Product. You must procure a separate license to use other Shannon software. Furthermore, you may not permit end users of the Product (&quot;End Users&quot;) to conduct the restricted activities limited by items (a) through (e), (g) and (h) above insofar as they apply to certain files, libraries and/or source code specifically designated as &quot;redistributables&quot; by Shannon in the accompanying printed or on-line documentation and that are necessary to use your own application programs and other works created using the Product (&quot;Redistributables&quot;), and such End User&apos;s sublicense rights to the Redistributables are conditioned upon compliance with such limitations. The limitations in this Section 3 apply equally to your use of the Product, in whole or in part, including any component or Redistributable.&#xA;&#xA;4. LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER&#xA;Shannon warrants to you, the original purchaser and to no other party, that any physical media included with the Product, as and when provided to you, will be free of physical defects in materials and workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days after the date that you initially acquire the Product.

THE PRODUCT IS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU, THE ORIGINAL PURCHASER,&#xA;SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING LICENSE AGREEMENT (&quot;LICENSE AGREEMENT&quot;). PLEASE&#xA;READ THIS LICENSE CAREFULLY BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING THE PRODUCT. A COPY&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE IS AVAILABLE FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE IN THE&#xA;&quot;LICENSE.HTML&quot;FILE PROVIDED WITH THE PRODUCT.&#xA;&#xA;IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES&#xA;INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE PRODUCT. ANY USE&#xA;BY YOU OF THIS PRODUCT ALSO CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS.&#xA;&#xA;Shannon is only willing to grant you a license under this License Agreement if you obtained the Product from&#xA;Shannon or a Shannon authorized distributor or reseller. If you obtained the Product from any other source you&#xA;may not install or use the Product.&#xA;&#xA;1. GRANT OF LICENSE AND SCOPE OF USE&#xA;&#xA;1.1 Licenses   For each license that you acquire to use the Product, you will be provided with a License Certificate (a &quot;License Certificate&quot;), which may be either a certificate, the installation and licensing instructions, your invoice, or an activation file and which may be provided to you either with the Product media or separately by Shannon or its authorized distributors or resellers. The License Certificate will contain information specific to the Product, the type of license under which you may use the Product and the number of licenses that you have acquired. In order to activate and use the Product as set forth in this License Agreement, you must follow the instructions when prompted by the Product. The types of licenses you may acquire are an Evaluation License, a Named User License, all defined in this Section 1 of this License Agreement. Unless your License Certificate identifies your acquisition of another license type, you have acquired a Named User License. For more information on which license types, if any, should be included with the Product media you should contact Shannon or your&#xA;Shannon authorized distributor or reseller.&#xA;&#xA;1.2 Evaluation Period   In order to evaluate the Product, you may install the Product, as outlined below, on a temporary basis for evaluation, non-commercial purposes only (the &quot;Evaluation Period&quot;). The Evaluation Period is limited to the lesser of the period of time specified to you by Shannon or ninety (90) days from the date the Product is installed. At the end of the Evaluation Period your license to use the Product expires. During the Evaluation Period, Shannon grants you the personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product solely for evaluation purposes. THE PRODUCT CONTAINS A TIME-OUT FEATURE THAT DISABLES ITS OPERATION AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD. APPLICATIONS THAT YOU CREATE DURING THE EVALUATION PERIOD MAY REQUIRE THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO RUN. UPON EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD, THOSE APPLICATIONS WILL NO LONGER RUN. YOU SHOULD THEREFORE TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT RESULT. In order to use the Product after the Evaluation Period, you must obtain from Shannon, or its authorized distributors or resellers a License Key Certificate outlining the number and type of grants of a license to use the Product in accordance with the terms and conditions of this  License Agreement. You may not use the Product during the Evaluation Period for any commercial, business,  governmental or institutional purpose of any kind. At the end of the Evaluation Period, further use of the Product  by you is prohibited without the purchase of a commercial license to obtain a License Key Certificate. If you do  not purchase a license for the Product at the end of the Evaluation Period, you hereby agree to permanently  remove or delete the Product from all computer systems, including servers, workstations, microsystems, on which  it was installed and deployed any software and documentation received, and not to reinstall the Product. If you  desire to continue to use the Product following the Evaluation Period, you should contact Shannon or a Shannon authorized distributor or reseller to order commercial licenses to use the Product. &#xA;&#xA;1.3 Named User Grant of License   The terms of this Section 1.3 are applicable to you only if you have  purchased a Named User License, as defined below, for the Product directly from Shannon or a Shannon authorized distributor or reseller. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Shannon grants to you, if you are an individual, or, if you are an entity, one (1) designated person in your organization (&quot;Named User&quot;) a personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product solely for your own internal purposes. You may purchase from shannon or a shannon authorized distributor or reseller additional licenses to permit multiple Named Users to use the Product (each, a &quot;Named User License&quot;). The foregoing Named User Licenses shall be for access and use, only by the equivalent number of Named Users for whom you have paid the applicable license fees and obtained a License Key Certificate. The Product may be used exclusively by the specifically designated Named Users, subject to all the terms and conditions of this License Agreement. You agree that you will not designate more Named Users than the number of Named User Licenses that Shannon or a Shannon authorized distributor or reseller has expressly granted to you and you will not allow the Product to be used by any individuals other than the Named Users designated by you from time to time. You may install the Product on a reasonable number of machines provided that the Named User is the only individual permitted to use the Product. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this License, you may make a reasonable number of copies of the Product to backup devices such as hard disks, optical media, or tape and one (1) physical CD media backup copy of the Product solely to replace the original copy provided to you if the original copy is damaged or destroyed. All rights not specifically granted to you herein are retained by Shannon.&#xA;&#xA;2. SPECIAL TERMS&#xA;The following terms and conditions (&quot;Special Terms&quot;) are specific to certain editions, versions and components of the Product and are in addition to the provisions of Section 1. If any provision of the Special Terms applicable to the Product conflicts with any other provision of this License, then the provision of the Special Terms will supercede and control. &#xA;&#xA;2.1 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO SOFTWARE LICENSED FOR EDUCATIONAL USE Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you may exercise your rights under this License Agreement to  use the Product solely for your own personal use in providing or receiving instruction within the limited scope of guided computer programming and/or software training courses (&quot;Courses&quot;) in which you are a direct and personal participant, either as student or instructor.

The rights granted under this License apply only to this Product. You must procure a separate license to use other Shannon software. Furthermore, you may not permit end users of the Product (&quot;End Users&quot;) to conduct the restricted activities limited by items (a) through (e), (g) and (h) above insofar as they apply to certain files, libraries and/or source code specifically designated as &quot;redistributables&quot; by Shannon in the accompanying printed or on-line documentation and that are necessary to use your own application programs and other works created using the Product (&quot;Redistributables&quot;), and such End User&apos;s sublicense rights to the Redistributables are conditioned upon compliance with such limitations. The limitations in this Section 3 apply equally to your use of the Product, in whole or in part, including any component or Redistributable.&#xA;&#xA;4. LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER&#xA;Shannon warrants to you, the original purchaser and to no other party, that any physical media included with the Product, as and when provided to you, will be free of physical defects in materials and workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days after the date that you initially acquire the Product.

A COPY&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE IS AVAILABLE FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE IN THE&#xA;&quot;LICENSE.HTML&quot;FILE PROVIDED WITH THE PRODUCT.&#xA;&#xA;IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES&#xA;INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE PRODUCT. ANY USE&#xA;BY YOU OF THIS PRODUCT ALSO CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS.&#xA;&#xA;ASN Lab is only willing to grant you a license under this License Agreement if you obtained the Product from&#xA;ASN Lab or a ASN Lab authorized distributor or reseller. If you obtained the Product from any other source you&#xA;may not install or use the Product.&#xA;&#xA;1. GRANT OF LICENSE AND SCOPE OF USE&#xA;&#xA;1.1 Licenses   For each license that you acquire to use the Product, you will be provided with a License Key (a &quot;License Key&quot;), which contains the installation and licensing instructions, an activation key and which may be provided to you either with the Product media or separately by ASN Lab or its authorized distributors or resellers. The License Key will contain information specific to the Product, the type of license under which you may use the Product and the number of licenses that you have acquired. In order to activate and use the Product as set forth in this License Agreement, you must follow the instructions when prompted by the Product. The types of licenses you may acquire are an Evaluation License, a Developer License, all defined in this Section 1 of this License Agreement. Unless your License Key identifies your acquisition of another license type, you have acquired a Developer License. For more information on which license types, if any, should be included with the Product media you should contact ASN Lab or your&#xA;ASN Lab authorized distributor or reseller.&#xA;&#xA;1.2 Evaluation License   In order to evaluate the Product, you may install the Product, as outlined below, on a temporary basis for evaluation, non-commercial purposes only (the &quot;Evaluation Period&quot;). The Evaluation Period is limited to the lesser of the period of time specified to you by ASN Lab or thirty (30) days from the date the Product is installed. At the end of the Evaluation Period your license to use the Product expires. During the Evaluation Period, ASN Lab grants you the personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product solely for evaluation purposes. THE PRODUCT CONTAINS A TIME-OUT FEATURE THAT DISABLES ITS OPERATION AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD. APPLICATIONS THAT YOU CREATE DURING THE EVALUATION PERIOD MAY REQUIRE THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO RUN. UPON EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD, THOSE APPLICATIONS WILL NO LONGER RUN. YOU SHOULD THEREFORE TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT RESULT. In order to use the Product after the Evaluation Period, you must obtain from ASN Lab, or its authorized distributors or resellers a License Key outlining the number and type of grants of a license to use the Product in accordance with the terms and conditions of this  License Agreement. You may not use the Product during the Evaluation Period for any commercial, business,  governmental or institutional purpose of any kind. At the end of the Evaluation Period, further use of the Product  by you is prohibited without the purchase of a commercial license to obtain a License Key. If you do  not purchase a license for the Product at the end of the Evaluation Period, you hereby agree to permanently  remove or delete the Product from all computer systems, including servers, workstations, microsystems, on which  it was installed and deployed any software and documentation received, and not to reinstall the Product. If you  desire to continue to use the Product following the Evaluation Period, you should contact ASN Lab or a ASN Lab authorized distributor or reseller to order commercial licenses to use the Product. &#xA;&#xA;1.3 Developer License   The terms of this Section 1.3 are applicable to you only if you have  purchased a Developer License, as defined below, for the Product directly from ASN Lab or a ASN Lab authorized distributor or reseller. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, ASN Lab grants to you, if you are an individual, or, if you are an entity, one (1) designated person in your organization (&quot;Developer&quot;) a personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product solely for your own internal purposes. You may purchase from ASN Lab or a ASN Lab authorized distributor or reseller additional licenses to permit multiple Developers to use the Product (each, a &quot;Developer License&quot;). The foregoing Developer Licenses shall be for access and use, only by the equivalent number of Developers for whom you have paid the applicable license fees and obtained a License Key. The Product may be used exclusively by the specifically designated Developers, subject to all the terms and conditions of this License Agreement. You agree that you will not designate more Developers than the number of Developer Licenses that ASN Lab or a ASN Lab authorized distributor or reseller has expressly granted to you and you will not allow the Product to be used by any individuals other than the Developers designated by you from time to time. You may install the Product on a reasonable number of machines provided that the Developer is the only individual permitted to use the Product. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this License, you may make a reasonable number of copies of the Product to backup devices such as hard disks, optical media, or tape and one (1) physical CD media backup copy of the Product solely to replace the original copy provided to you if the original copy is damaged or destroyed. All rights not specifically granted to you herein are retained by ASN Lab.&#xA;&#xA;2. SPECIAL TERMS&#xA;The following terms and conditions (&quot;Special Terms&quot;) are specific to certain editions, versions and components of the Product and are in addition to the provisions of Section 1. If any provision of the Special Terms applicable to the Product conflicts with any other provision of this License, then the provision of the Special Terms will supercede and control. &#xA;&#xA;2.1 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO SOFTWARE LICENSED FOR EDUCATIONAL USE Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you may exercise your rights under this License Agreement to  use the Product solely for your own personal use in providing or receiving instruction within the limited scope of guided computer programming and/or software training courses (&quot;Courses&quot;) in which you are a direct and personal participant, either as student or instructor. You may not use any Works created with the Product for any commercial, business, governmental or institutional purpose of any kind, except to the extent you are an instructor teaching a Course. All rights not specifically granted to you herein are retained by ASN Lab.&#xA;&#xA;3.

The limitations in this Section 3 apply equally to your use of the Product, in whole or in part, including any component or Redistributable.&#xA;&#xA;4. LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER&#xA;ASN Lab warrants to you, the original purchaser and to no other party, that any physical media included with the Product, as and when provided to you, will be free of physical defects in materials and workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days after the date that you initially acquire the Product. Your exclusive remedy and ASN Lab&apos;s sole liability for breach of this warranty is that ASN Lab will replace any defective media returned to ASN Lab within the ninety (90) day warranty period. This warranty does not apply to damages resulting from misuse, abuse or neglect. Any replacement media will be warranted as above for the remainder of the original warranty period or twenty (20) days from the date we ship it to you, whichever is longer. EXCEPT FOR THIS EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTY, THE PRODUCT IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. ASN LAB HEREBY EXCLUDES AND DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, RESULTS, EFFORTS OR QUIET ENJOYMENT. THERE IS NO WARRANTY THAT THE PRODUCT WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR WILL FUNCTION WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK FOR THE RESULTS OBTAINED USING THE PRODUCT. TO THE EXTENT THAT ASN LAB MAY NOT DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY AS A MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW, THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF SUCH WARRANTY WILL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED UNDER SUCH LAW.&#xA;&#xA;5. SERVICES; UPDATES; PRODUCT CHANGES&#xA;ASN Lab is not required under this License Agreement to provide any installation, training or other services to you. Such services, if available, must be purchased separately. If, pursuant to a separate support agreement or otherwise, ASN Lab provides you with a new release, error correction, update, upgrade or other modification to the Product, such modification will be deemed part of the Product, and subject to the terms of this License Agreement, unless the modification is expressly provided subject to a separate license agreement. ASN Lab reserves the right at any time not to release or to discontinue release of any Product and to alter prices, features, specifications, capabilities, functions, licensing terms, release dates, general availability or other characteristics of any future releases of the Product.&#xA;&#xA;6. REGISTRATION&#xA;You must register the Product with ASN Lab as a condition to your rights to use the Product. You will be prompted to register the Product at the time of your installation or first use of the Product, at which time you will be notified (or directed to online resources explaining) how registration information provided by you may be used and you will be afforded the opportunity to opt out of certain uses of such information.&#xA;&#xA;7. CONFIDENTIALITY&#xA;You acknowledge that the Product in source code form remains a confidential trade secret of ASN Lab. You agree to hold this information in confidence, not disclose it to any person, and not use it for any purpose other than the use and operation of the Product as permitted under this License Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY&#xA;IN NO EVENT WILL ASN LAB BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY OR DATA, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT OR THE PRODUCT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ASN LAB KNEW, SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ASN LAB&apos;S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT OR THE PRODUCT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU UNDER THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT.

THE PRODUCT IS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU, THE ORIGINAL PURCHASER,&#xA;SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING LICENSE AGREEMENT (&quot;LICENSE AGREEMENT&quot;). PLEASE&#xA;READ THIS LICENSE CAREFULLY BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING THE PRODUCT. A COPY&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE IS AVAILABLE FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE IN THE&#xA;&quot;LICENSE.HTML&quot;FILE PROVIDED WITH THE PRODUCT.&#xA;&#xA;IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES&#xA;INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE PRODUCT. ANY USE&#xA;BY YOU OF THIS PRODUCT ALSO CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS.&#xA;&#xA;Shannon is only willing to grant you a license under this License Agreement if you obtained the Product from&#xA;Shannon or a Shannon authorized distributor or reseller. If you obtained the Product from any other source you&#xA;may not install or use the Product.&#xA;&#xA;1. GRANT OF LICENSE AND SCOPE OF USE&#xA;&#xA;1.1 Licenses   For each license that you acquire to use the Product, you will be provided with a License Certificate (a &quot;License Certificate&quot;), which may be either a certificate, the installation and licensing instructions, your invoice, or an activation file and which may be provided to you either with the Product media or separately by Shannon or its authorized distributors or resellers. The License Certificate will contain information specific to the Product, the type of license under which you may use the Product and the number of licenses that you have acquired. In order to activate and use the Product as set forth in this License Agreement, you must follow the instructions when prompted by the Product. The types of licenses you may acquire are an Evaluation License, a Named User License, all defined in this Section 1 of this License Agreement. Unless your License Certificate identifies your acquisition of another license type, you have acquired a Named User License. For more information on which license types, if any, should be included with the Product media you should contact Shannon or your&#xA;Shannon authorized distributor or reseller.&#xA;&#xA;1.2 Evaluation Period   In order to evaluate the Product, you may install the Product, as outlined below, on a temporary basis for evaluation, non-commercial purposes only (the &quot;Evaluation Period&quot;). The Evaluation Period is limited to the lesser of the period of time specified to you by Shannon or ninety (90) days from the date the Product is installed. At the end of the Evaluation Period your license to use the Product expires. During the Evaluation Period, Shannon grants you the personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product solely for evaluation purposes. THE PRODUCT CONTAINS A TIME-OUT FEATURE THAT DISABLES ITS OPERATION AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD.

YOU SHOULD THEREFORE TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT RESULT. In order to use the Product after the Evaluation Period, you must obtain from Shannon, or its authorized distributors or resellers a License Key Certificate outlining the number and type of grants of a license to use the Product in accordance with the terms and conditions of this  License Agreement.

        <property name='df_LT.license' value='SHANNON CORPORATION LICENSE TERMS&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE: THIS SHANNON SOFTWARE PRODUCT, TOGETHER WITH ITS ACCOMPANYING&#xA;DOCUMENTATION, (THE &quot;RODUCT&quot;) IS THE PROPERTY OF SHANNON CORPORATION&#xA;(&quot;SHANNON&quot;). THE PRODUCT IS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU, THE ORIGINAL PURCHASER,&#xA;SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING LICENSE AGREEMENT (&quot;LICENSE AGREEMENT&quot;). PLEASE&#xA;READ THIS LICENSE CAREFULLY BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING THE PRODUCT. A COPY&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE IS AVAILABLE FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE IN THE&#xA;&quot;LICENSE.HTML&quot;FILE PROVIDED WITH THE PRODUCT.&#xA;&#xA;IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES&#xA;INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE PRODUCT. ANY USE&#xA;BY YOU OF THIS PRODUCT ALSO CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS.&#xA;&#xA;Shannon is only willing to grant you a license under this License Agreement if you obtained the Product from&#xA;Shannon or a Shannon authorized distributor or reseller. If you obtained the Product from any other source you&#xA;may not install or use the Product.&#xA;&#xA;1. GRANT OF LICENSE AND SCOPE OF USE&#xA;&#xA;1.1 Licenses   For each license that you acquire to use the Product, you will be provided with a License Certificate (a &quot;License Certificate&quot;), which may be either a certificate, the installation and licensing instructions, your invoice, or an activation file and which may be provided to you either with the Product media or separately by Shannon or its authorized distributors or resellers. The License Certificate will contain information specific to the Product, the type of license under which you may use the Product and the number of licenses that you have acquired. In order to activate and use the Product as set forth in this License Agreement, you must follow the instructions when prompted by the Product. The types of licenses you may acquire are an Evaluation License, a Named User License, all defined in this Section 1 of this License Agreement. Unless your License Certificate identifies your acquisition of another license type, you have acquired a Named User License. For more information on which license types, if any, should be included with the Product media you should contact Shannon or your&#xA;Shannon authorized distributor or reseller.&#xA;&#xA;1.2 Evaluation Period   In order to evaluate the Product, you may install the Product, as outlined below, on a temporary basis for evaluation, non-commercial purposes only (the &quot;Evaluation Period&quot;). The Evaluation Period is limited to the lesser of the period of time specified to you by Shannon or ninety (90) days from the date the Product is installed. At the end of the Evaluation Period your license to use the Product expires. During the Evaluation Period, Shannon grants you the personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product solely for evaluation purposes. THE PRODUCT CONTAINS A TIME-OUT FEATURE THAT DISABLES ITS OPERATION AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD. APPLICATIONS THAT YOU CREATE DURING THE EVALUATION PERIOD MAY REQUIRE THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO RUN. UPON EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD, THOSE APPLICATIONS WILL NO LONGER RUN. YOU SHOULD THEREFORE TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT RESULT. In order to use the Product after the Evaluation Period, you must obtain from Shannon, or its authorized distributors or resellers a License Key Certificate outlining the number and type of grants of a license to use the Product in accordance with the terms and conditions of this  License Agreement. You may not use the Product during the Evaluation Period for any commercial, business,  governmental or institutional purpose of any kind. At the end of the Evaluation Period, further use of the Product  by you is prohibited without the purchase of a commercial license to obtain a License Key Certificate. If you do  not purchase a license for the Product at the end of the Evaluation Period, you hereby agree to permanently  remove or delete the Product from all computer systems, including servers, workstations, microsystems, on which  it was installed and deployed any software and documentation received, and not to reinstall the Product. If you  desire to continue to use the Product following the Evaluation Period, you should contact Shannon or a Shannon authorized distributor or reseller to order commercial licenses to use the Product. &#xA;&#xA;1.3 Named User Grant of License   The terms of this Section 1.3 are applicable to you only if you have  purchased a Named User License, as defined below, for the Product directly from Shannon or a Shannon authorized distributor or reseller. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Shannon grants to you, if you are an individual, or, if you are an entity, one (1) designated person in your organization (&quot;Named User&quot;) a personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product solely for your own internal purposes. You may purchase from shannon or a shannon authorized distributor or reseller additional licenses to permit multiple Named Users to use the Product (each, a &quot;Named User License&quot;). The foregoing Named User Licenses shall be for access and use, only by the equivalent number of Named Users for whom you have paid the applicable license fees and obtained a License Key Certificate. The Product may be used exclusively by the specifically designated Named Users, subject to all the terms and conditions of this License Agreement. You agree that you will not designate more Named Users than the number of Named User Licenses that Shannon or a Shannon authorized distributor or reseller has expressly granted to you and you will not allow the Product to be used by any individuals other than the Named Users designated by you from time to time. You may install the Product on a reasonable number of machines provided that the Named User is the only individual permitted to use the Product. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this License, you may make a reasonable number of copies of the Product to backup devices such as hard disks, optical media, or tape and one (1) physical CD media backup copy of the Product solely to replace the original copy provided to you if the original copy is damaged or destroyed. All rights not specifically granted to you herein are retained by Shannon.&#xA;&#xA;2. SPECIAL TERMS&#xA;The following terms and conditions (&quot;Special Terms&quot;) are specific to certain editions, versions and components of the Product and are in addition to the provisions of Section 1. If any provision of the Special Terms applicable to the Product conflicts with any other provision of this License, then the provision of the Special Terms will supercede and control. &#xA;&#xA;2.1 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO SOFTWARE LICENSED FOR EDUCATIONAL USE Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you may exercise your rights under this License Agreement to  use the Product solely for your own personal use in providing or receiving instruction within the limited scope of guided computer programming and/or software training courses (&quot;Courses&quot;) in which you are a direct and personal participant, either as student or instructor.

Furthermore, you may not permit end users of the Product (&quot;End Users&quot;) to conduct the restricted activities limited by items (a) through (e), (g) and (h) above insofar as they apply to certain files, libraries and/or source code specifically designated as &quot;redistributables&quot; by Shannon in the accompanying printed or on-line documentation and that are necessary to use your own application programs and other works created using the Product (&quot;Redistributables&quot;), and such End User&apos;s sublicense rights to the Redistributables are conditioned upon compliance with such limitations. The limitations in this Section 3 apply equally to your use of the Product, in whole or in part, including any component or Redistributable.&#xA;&#xA;4. LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER&#xA;Shannon warrants to you, the original purchaser and to no other party, that any physical media included with the Product, as and when provided to you, will be free of physical defects in materials and workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days after the date that you initially acquire the Product. Your exclusive remedy and Shannon&apos;s sole liability for breach of this warranty is that Shannon will replace any defective media returned to Shannon within the ninety (90) day warranty period.

Such services, if available, must be purchased separately. If, pursuant to a separate support agreement or otherwise, Shannon provides you with a new release, error correction, update, upgrade or other modification to the Product, such modification will be deemed part of the Product, and subject to the terms of this License Agreement, unless the modification is expressly provided subject to a separate license agreement. Shannon reserves the right at any time not to release or to discontinue release of any Product and to alter prices, features, specifications, capabilities, functions, licensing terms, release dates, general availability or other characteristics of any future releases of the Product.&#xA;&#xA;6.

        <property name='df_LT.license' value='SHANNON CORPORATION LICENSE TERMS&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;NOTICE: THIS SHANNON SOFTWARE PRODUCT, TOGETHER WITH ITS ACCOMPANYING&#xA;DOCUMENTATION, (THE &quot;RODUCT&quot;) IS THE PROPERTY OF SHANNON CORPORATION&#xA;(&quot;SHANNON&quot;). THE PRODUCT IS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU, THE ORIGINAL PURCHASER,&#xA;SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING LICENSE AGREEMENT (&quot;LICENSE AGREEMENT&quot;). PLEASE&#xA;READ THIS LICENSE CAREFULLY BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING THE PRODUCT. A COPY&#xA;OF THIS LICENSE IS AVAILABLE FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE IN THE&#xA;&quot;LICENSE.HTML&quot;FILE PROVIDED WITH THE PRODUCT.&#xA;&#xA;IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES&#xA;INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE PRODUCT. ANY USE&#xA;BY YOU OF THIS PRODUCT ALSO CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS.&#xA;&#xA;Shannon is only willing to grant you a license under this License Agreement if you obtained the Product from&#xA;Shannon or a Shannon authorized distributor or reseller. If you obtained the Product from any other source you&#xA;may not install or use the Product.&#xA;&#xA;1. GRANT OF LICENSE AND SCOPE OF USE&#xA;&#xA;1.1 Licenses   For each license that you acquire to use the Product, you will be provided with a License Certificate (a &quot;License Certificate&quot;), which may be either a certificate, the installation and licensing instructions, your invoice, or an activation file and which may be provided to you either with the Product media or separately by Shannon or its authorized distributors or resellers. The License Certificate will contain information specific to the Product, the type of license under which you may use the Product and the number of licenses that you have acquired. In order to activate and use the Product as set forth in this License Agreement, you must follow the instructions when prompted by the Product. The types of licenses you may acquire are an Evaluation License, a Named User License, all defined in this Section 1 of this License Agreement. Unless your License Certificate identifies your acquisition of another license type, you have acquired a Named User License. For more information on which license types, if any, should be included with the Product media you should contact Shannon or your&#xA;Shannon authorized distributor or reseller.&#xA;&#xA;1.2 Evaluation Period   In order to evaluate the Product, you may install the Product, as outlined below, on a temporary basis for evaluation, non-commercial purposes only (the &quot;Evaluation Period&quot;). The Evaluation Period is limited to the lesser of the period of time specified to you by Shannon or ninety (90) days from the date the Product is installed. At the end of the Evaluation Period your license to use the Product expires. During the Evaluation Period, Shannon grants you the personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product solely for evaluation purposes. THE PRODUCT CONTAINS A TIME-OUT FEATURE THAT DISABLES ITS OPERATION AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD. APPLICATIONS THAT YOU CREATE DURING THE EVALUATION PERIOD MAY REQUIRE THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO RUN. UPON EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD, THOSE APPLICATIONS WILL NO LONGER RUN. YOU SHOULD THEREFORE TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT RESULT. In order to use the Product after the Evaluation Period, you must obtain from Shannon, or its authorized distributors or resellers a License Key Certificate outlining the number and type of grants of a license to use the Product in accordance with the terms and conditions of this  License Agreement. You may not use the Product during the Evaluation Period for any commercial, business,  governmental or institutional purpose of any kind. At the end of the Evaluation Period, further use of the Product  by you is prohibited without the purchase of a commercial license to obtain a License Key Certificate. If you do  not purchase a license for the Product at the end of the Evaluation Period, you hereby agree to permanently  remove or delete the Product from all computer systems, including servers, workstations, microsystems, on which  it was installed and deployed any software and documentation received, and not to reinstall the Product. If you  desire to continue to use the Product following the Evaluation Period, you should contact Shannon or a Shannon authorized distributor or reseller to order commercial licenses to use the Product. &#xA;&#xA;1.3 Named User Grant of License   The terms of this Section 1.3 are applicable to you only if you have  purchased a Named User License, as defined below, for the Product directly from Shannon or a Shannon authorized distributor or reseller. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Shannon grants to you, if you are an individual, or, if you are an entity, one (1) designated person in your organization (&quot;Named User&quot;) a personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product solely for your own internal purposes. You may purchase from shannon or a shannon authorized distributor or reseller additional licenses to permit multiple Named Users to use the Product (each, a &quot;Named User License&quot;). The foregoing Named User Licenses shall be for access and use, only by the equivalent number of Named Users for whom you have paid the applicable license fees and obtained a License Key Certificate. The Product may be used exclusively by the specifically designated Named Users, subject to all the terms and conditions of this License Agreement. You agree that you will not designate more Named Users than the number of Named User Licenses that Shannon or a Shannon authorized distributor or reseller has expressly granted to you and you will not allow the Product to be used by any individuals other than the Named Users designated by you from time to time. You may install the Product on a reasonable number of machines provided that the Named User is the only individual permitted to use the Product. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this License, you may make a reasonable number of copies of the Product to backup devices such as hard disks, optical media, or tape and one (1) physical CD media backup copy of the Product solely to replace the original copy provided to you if the original copy is damaged or destroyed. All rights not specifically granted to you herein are retained by Shannon.&#xA;&#xA;2. SPECIAL TERMS&#xA;The following terms and conditions (&quot;Special Terms&quot;) are specific to certain editions, versions and components of the Product and are in addition to the provisions of Section 1. If any provision of the Special Terms applicable to the Product conflicts with any other provision of this License, then the provision of the Special Terms will supercede and control. &#xA;&#xA;2.1 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO SOFTWARE LICENSED FOR EDUCATIONAL USE Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you may exercise your rights under this License Agreement to  use the Product solely for your own personal use in providing or receiving instruction within the limited scope of guided computer programming and/or software training courses (&quot;Courses&quot;) in which you are a direct and personal participant, either as student or instructor. You may not use any Works created with the Product for any commercial, business, governmental or institutional purpose of any kind, except to the extent you are an instructor teaching a Course. All rights not specifically granted to you herein are retained by Shannon.&#xA;&#xA;2.2 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE Certain components of the Product use or incorporate third-party software programs and/or libraries (&quot;Third-Party Software&quot;),  which are loaded (in both object and source code form) on the Product media. You agree that  Shannon&apos;s third-party licensors and suppliers are intended third party beneficiaries of all terms and conditions of  this License intended to protect intellectual property rights in the Product (including the Third-Party Software) and  limit certain uses thereof. &#xA;&#xA;3. LIMITATIONS&#xA;You may not: (a) modify, adapt, alter, translate, or create derivative works of the Product or merge the Product with other software other than as described in the Product&apos;s accompanying documentation or as approved of in writing by Shannon; (b) lease, rent or loan the Product to any third party; (c) sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Product or any component thereof to any third party except as expressly authorized in this Agreement; (d) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Product; (e) remove, alter, or obscure any confidentiality or proprietary notices (including copyright and trademark notices) of Shannon or its licensors or suppliers on or accompanying the Product; (f) allow third parties to access or use the Product including but not limited to using the Product in a time-sharing arrangement, operating the Product as part of a service bureau or, except as expressly authorized under Sections 1 and 2 otherwise using the Product for the use or benefit of third parties; (g) reproduce or use the Product except as expressly authorized under Sections 1 and 2; or (h) disclose or publish performance benchmark results for the Product. The rights granted under this License apply only to this Product. You must procure a separate license to use other Shannon software. Furthermore, you may not permit end users of the Product (&quot;End Users&quot;) to conduct the restricted activities limited by items (a) through (e), (g) and (h) above insofar as they apply to certain files, libraries and/or source code specifically designated as &quot;redistributables&quot; by Shannon in the accompanying printed or on-line documentation and that are necessary to use your own application programs and other works created using the Product (&quot;Redistributables&quot;), and such End User&apos;s sublicense rights to the Redistributables are conditioned upon compliance with such limitations. The limitations in this Section 3 apply equally to your use of the Product, in whole or in part, including any component or Redistributable.&#xA;&#xA;4. LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER&#xA;Shannon warrants to you, the original purchaser and to no other party, that any physical media included with the Product, as and when provided to you, will be free of physical defects in materials and workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days after the date that you initially acquire the Product. Your exclusive remedy and Shannon&apos;s sole liability for breach of this warranty is that Shannon will replace any defective media returned to Shannon within the ninety (90) day warranty period. This warranty does not apply to damages resulting from misuse, abuse or neglect. Any replacement media will be warranted as above for the remainder of the original warranty period or twenty (20) days from the date we ship it to you, whichever is longer. EXCEPT FOR THIS EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTY, THE PRODUCT IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. SHANNON HEREBY EXCLUDES AND DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, RESULTS, EFFORTS OR QUIET ENJOYMENT. THERE IS NO WARRANTY THAT THE PRODUCT WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR WILL FUNCTION WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK FOR THE RESULTS OBTAINED USING THE PRODUCT. TO THE EXTENT THAT SHANNON MAY NOT DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY AS A MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW, THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF SUCH WARRANTY WILL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED UNDER SUCH LAW.&#xA;&#xA;5. SERVICES; UPDATES; PRODUCT CHANGES&#xA;Shannon is not required under this License Agreement to provide any installation, training or other services to you. Such services, if available, must be purchased separately. If, pursuant to a separate support agreement or otherwise, Shannon provides you with a new release, error correction, update, upgrade or other modification to the Product, such modification will be deemed part of the Product, and subject to the terms of this License Agreement, unless the modification is expressly provided subject to a separate license agreement. Shannon reserves the right at any time not to release or to discontinue release of any Product and to alter prices, features, specifications, capabilities, functions, licensing terms, release dates, general availability or other characteristics of any future releases of the Product.&#xA;&#xA;6. REGISTRATION&#xA;You must register the Product with Shannon as a condition to your rights to use the Product.

CONFIDENTIALITY&#xA;You acknowledge that the Product in source code form remains a confidential trade secret of Shannon. You agree to hold this information in confidence, not disclose it to any person, and not use it for any purpose other than the use and operation of the Product as permitted under this License Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY&#xA;IN NO EVENT WILL SHANNON BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY OR DATA, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT OR THE PRODUCT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SHANNON KNEW, SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SHANNON&apos;S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT OR THE PRODUCT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU UNDER THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT. THIS SECTION 8 WILL APPLY EVEN IF AN EXCLUSIVE REMEDY HEREUNDER HAS FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.&#xA;&#xA;9.
